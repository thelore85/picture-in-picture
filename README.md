# Picture-in-Picture App in JavaScript

This project is a JavaScript application that utilizes the browser's `mediaDevices` web API to offer Picture-in-Picture (PiP) functionality. With this app, you can select a screen area and display it in a separate PiP window.

## How It Works

1. Click the "Select Screen" button to choose the screen area you want to display in the PiP window.
2. Once the screen is selected, click the "Show PiP" button to start the Picture-in-Picture display.

## Requirements

To use this app, ensure that you have a browser compatible with the `mediaDevices` API and support for the Picture-in-Picture feature.

## How to Use the Code

The main JavaScript code for the program can be found in the `script.js` file. The application also uses an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS style file (`styles.css`) for the UI structure and appearance.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository using the `git clone` command or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Used APIs

- `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`: Used to gain access to the screen area selected by the user.
- `videoElement.requestPictureInPicture()`: Used to initiate Picture-in-Picture mode with the selected video.
